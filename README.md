# ScanRDS
Android code for FM Radio Data System Scanner

Scans pre-defined FM stations for currently playing song title and artist. Communicates via a simple REST interface with a Raspberry Pi equipped with 2 FM radios. One plays the station and the other scans the dial and shows the artist and title on each station.
